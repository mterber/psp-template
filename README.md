# Hands-on Training Synchronous Programming

## Template Project
This template project for the STM32CubeIDE demonstrates a very basic (and naive) approach on how to integrate and run a synchronous Blech program in a C execution environment. It can be used as an initial setup for a more elaborate implementation.
